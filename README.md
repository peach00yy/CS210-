The project i chose is the clock project, i created a clock that would display both a 12 hr clock and 24 hr clock. As well as allow an individual to adjust the clocks hours, minutes and seconds. 

I feel i completed the project really well, i did exactly what was asked and provided code that met all the standards asked. 

I do believe that although my code worked i could have made it more effienct and potentially more simple, allowing for easier reading and maintenance. 

The most valuable lesson i learned from this project and all others was not to underestimate how long something that seems simple can take. I made this mistake and it cost me, but better i learn here than in the job field.
